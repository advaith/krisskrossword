nitpicky things

overall
[ ] fix spacing in world tab
[ ] debug 1 minute thing
[ ] incorporate a rolling average somewhere - probably in creating the world plot
[ ] script to scrape all past scores instead of chrome-app-based thing
[ ] event driven updates instead of continuous polling 
    # this could mean a listener on your friends' score nodes, which redraws all graphs that would be affected by an incoming score
    # chrome local storage variable to decide wehther or not to bind listener for completed crossword.
      aka if this variable is true, don't do anything and store this day's score locally
      if its not, listen for this event and write once
[ ] make checked status an emoji
[ ] fix reporting edge cases

you tab
[ ] add option to toggle between histogram and box plot
[ ] then include a trend chart of times over the weeks for different days 
[ ] debug graphs so that if there's no data, the graphs aren't rendered

world tab
[ ] center y axis labels
[ ] add horizontal graph of today's times from the world 
[ ] include only last 30 scores for each user;
[ ] why does tuesday not show up

friend tab
[ ] add graph of improvement over last 15 of those days (15 week) or even 10, so it's a 10 week rolling average
      (conditioned on day), ending in today's puzzle if you've finished it
[ ] make sure you can't add friends that don't exist :( ..... . . tbt
tab bar
[ ] fix spacing 


question: what's the daily reward of checking into the extension? there's the one-time intrigue of the graph generation but past that, is competing with your friends enough to bring you back to teh app every day?
